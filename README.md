# Dungeon Crawler 2023
Welcome to my Comp1000 Dungeon Crawler game

This game is programmed in C# using algorithms and loops to play a 2D game through CMD

## The goal of the game
The goal is to collect all the coins and reach the D on the map to finish the game

## Game setup
The game includes three maps:
- simple.map
- simple2.map
- advanced.map

To load a map type: load (mapname.map)

### Once the map has loaded
- If you wanted to add advanced (allowing monsters to move) type: advanced
- To start the game type: start

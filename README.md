# 2022-COMP1000-CW

This is the starting base for your second coursework. 

Use this ReadMe file to document your project by:
 * adding **important** details
 * showing images 
 * linking used resources such as guides, ie. [how to use markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
 
## What to do!
* install the required software ([dotnet sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), git, visual studio or notepad++, )
* Add your code into the required methods within the CMDCrawler.cs
* build the project on command line using `dotnet cake --target=Build --rebuild=true --verbosity=Diagnostic`
* test your project using `dotnet cake --target=Test --verbosity=Quiet`
* push your changes once you completed a part of it and iteratively work on it
* **SUBMIT** your _final_ codebase by the deadline and **DO NOT FORGET TO ALSO UPLOAD THE CONTENT OF CRAWLER AS DOC FILE**
 
## What to avoid!
* modifiy the build process
* change the used libraries or
* modify existing templates
* modify the tests
* start the project late
